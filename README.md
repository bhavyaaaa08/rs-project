# E-Commerce Product Recommendation System
This project implements a product recommendation system using two approaches:

   1. Rank-Based Recommendations
   2. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
An interactive interface is provided using Streamlit to allow users to explore and interact with these recommendation systems.

   1. Rank-Based Recommendation: Suggests popular products based on average user ratings.
   2. User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends products by finding similar users and suggesting items they liked.
   3. Streamlit App: User-friendly interface for testing and visualizing recommendations interactively.

   The dataset used in this project is the Amazon Electronics Ratings Dataset from Kaggle.
   It contains user ratings for various electronic products. The dataset is downloaded automatically using the kagglehub library.
